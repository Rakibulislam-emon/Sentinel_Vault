(node:24124) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///E:/sentinel-vault/sentinel-vault/eslint.config.js?mtime=1767551260608 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to E:\sentinel-vault\sentinel-vault\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
